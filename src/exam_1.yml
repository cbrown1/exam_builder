#         correct answer (for the key). Example:

# group_with & group: str
#     group_with is the name of a group near which the question 
#     should be placed. The idea is that sometimes several questions 
#     should follow one another (eg., they all refer to the same figure).  
#     All questions with the same "group_with" name will immediately 
#     follow the the first question found that has this "group" name.  
# 
#     Example:
# 
#     
#     question: Given the diagram above...
#     answer: no
#     group_with: anatomy # This item will follow an item with group: anatomy
# 
#     
#     question: Given the diagram above...
#     answer: yes
#     group: anatomy
