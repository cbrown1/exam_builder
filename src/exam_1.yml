# Each item has one required parameter: 'question' which should be a string
# Each item has one optional parameter of one of: "answer" | "answers" | ""
# "answer" should be a yaml string. Item treated as short-answer; string 
#           will show up on key but not on exam
# "answers" should be a yaml list. Treated as multiple choice, with each 
#           list item an option and the one prepended with a + is the
#           correct answer (for the key). Example:
#    - answer 1
#    - answer 2
#    - + answer 3 is correct
#"": If neither answer nor answers is given, the item is treated as an essay 
#    question, and no answer shows up on exam or key
